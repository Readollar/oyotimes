His Imperial Majesty has today released a statement urging parents and educational institutions within Oyo to prioritize the teaching of the Yoruba language.

"Our language is the vessel of our culture," the Alaafin stated. "To lose our tongue is to lose our identity. We must ensure that our children can speak proverbs with the same confidence they speak English."

The Palace has announced a new initiative to support local Yoruba literature competitions in secondary schools across the kingdom.
